        <h1>Damping</h1>
        <p id="nor">
            Duffing oscillators are routinely associated with damping in physical systems. Damping is an influence
            within or upon oscillatory system that has the effect of reducing, restricting or preventing its
            oscillation. Damping is produced by processes that dissipate the energy stored in the oscillation. Examples
            include viscous drag in mechanical systems, resistance in electronic oscillators, and absorption and
            scattering of light in optical oscillators. Damping not based on energy loss can be important in other
            oscillating systems such as those that occur in biological systems. The damping of a system can be described
            as being one of the following;
        </p>
        <p id="nor">
            - &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Overdamped</i>: the system returns (exponentially decays) to equilibrium without
            oscillating <br>
            - &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Critically damped</i>: the system returns to equilibrium as quickly as possible without
            oscillating <br>
            - &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Underdamped</i>: the system oscillates (at reduced frequency compared to the undamped case)
            with the amplitude <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gradually decreasing to zero <br>
            - &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Undamped</i>: the system oscillates at its natural resonant frequency
        </p>
        <p id="nor">
            As a practical example, consider a door that uses a spring to close the door once open. This can lead to any
            of the above types of damping. If the door is undamped, it will swing back and forth forever at a particular
            resonant frequency. If it is underdamped, it will swing back and forth with decreasing size of the swing
            until it comes to a stop. If it is critically damped, then it will return to closed as quickly as possible
            without oscillating. Finally, if it is overdamped, it will return to ‘closed’ without oscillating but more
            slowly depending on how overdamped it is.

        <h1>Chaos theory</h1>
        <p id="nor">
            Chaos theory is one of the most significant achievements of nonlinear science. The Duffing oscillator
            is also routinely associated with mathematical chaotic behavior. These chaotic behaviors exist in many
            natural systems such as weather and climate. It also occurs spontaneously in some systems with
            artificial components, such as road traffic. Chaos theory has applications in several disciplines including
            meteorology, sociology, environmental sciences, etc. According to <i>(Strogatz SH. Nonlinear dynamics and
                chaos. Perseus Books Publishin: Cambridge, M.A.; 1994)</i>, chaos is “is a periodic long-term
            behavior in a deterministic system that exhibits sensitive dependence on initial condition(s)”. Although
            there is no set definition of chaos, mathematicians agree that there are three properties that must exist in
            a dynamical system in order to be classified as chaotic:
        </p>
        <ul style="padding-left: 150px;list-style-type: square;">
            <li>
                <p>
                    It must have periodic long-term behavior meaning that the solution of the system settles into an
                    irregular patter as t → ∞ . The solution does not repeat or oscillate in a periodic manner.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    It is sensitive to initial conditions. This means that any small change in the initial condition
                    can change the trajectory, which may give a significantly different long-term behavior.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    It is sensitive to initial conditions. This means that any small change in the initial condition
                    can change the trajectory, which may give a significantly different long-term behavior.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p id="nor">
            Thus, Duffing oscillators find applications in Chaos theory, which is the field of study in mathematics that
            studies the behavior of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial condition(s) - a response
            popularly referred to as the butterfly effect. Small difference in initial conditions (such as those of
            rounding errors in numerical computation) yields widely diverging outcomes for such dynamical systems,
            rendering long-term prediction impossible in general. This happens even though these systems are
            deterministic, meaning that their future behavior if fully determined by their initial conditions, with no
            random elements involved.
        </p>
        <p id="nor">
            The theory was summarized by as <i>“Chaos: when the present determines the future, but the approximate
                present does not approximately determine the future”.</i>
